                <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
                    **Standing firm** means to hold fast to the unmerited favor that God has given us through Jesus Christ, not relying on our own works or efforts but trusting fully in His provision for salvation and sanctification. **Grace** is the foundation of our justification—God's free gift that makes us right with Him—and it also empowers us to live godly lives. We are called to stand firm, resisting **legalism and false teachings**, and to grow continually in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. This steadfastness involves humility, recognizing our complete dependence on God's grace, and living lives that reflect gratitude rather than licentiousness. Our confidence is not in ourselves but in the power of God’s grace that saves and sustains us. Therefore, standing firm in grace is both a **positional truth**—being justified and secure in Christ—and an **experiential reality**—growing in Christlikeness by relying on God's grace daily.

                            <li>We believe in the one living and true God, perfect in wisdom, sovereignty, holiness, justice, mercy, and love (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">1 Timothy 1:17; Psalm 86:15; Deuteronomy 32:3-4</span>). He exists eternally in three co-equal persons who act together in creation, providence, and redemption (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Genesis 1:26; 1 Peter 1:2; Hebrews 1:1-3</span>).</li>
                            <li>**God the Father,** who is the first person of the divine trinity, reigns with providential care over all life and history in His created universe (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">1 Chronicles 29:11-13; Matthew 7:11</span>). He initiated salvation by sending His Son, and He is Father to those who by faith accept His Son as Lord and Savior (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">1 John 4:9-10; John 3:16; John 1:12; Acts 16:31</span>).</li>
                            <li>**God the Son,** who is co-equal with the Father (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Colossians 1:15; Hebrews 1:3</span>), became man, was conceived of the Holy Spirit, and was born of the virgin Mary (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">John 1:14; Matthew 1:18</span>). Being fully God and fully man, He lived a sinless life through the power of the Holy Spirit, thus defeating Satan and sin through His offering of Himself on the cross for the sins of the world. By restricting His divine attributes, and living in reliance on the Holy Spirit during His earthly life He became the believer’s model for the spiritual life, whereby we are shown that we must also rely on the power of the Holy Spirit to please God (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Romans 8:1-4</span>). Since Jesus paid the penalty for the sins of the world through His death on the cross, faith in His atoning work is the only means by which a person may receive eternal life.</li>
                            <li>**God the Holy Spirit** inspired men to write the Scriptures (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">2 Peter 1:21</span>). Through this Word, He convicts individuals of their sinfulness and of the righteousness of Christ, draws them to the Savior (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">John 6:44; 12:32</span>), and bears witness to their new birth (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">James 1:18; John 16:7-11; 1 Thessalonians 1:5-6; Romans 8:16</span>). At regeneration and conversion, which happens at the moment of belief, the believer is baptized in the Holy Spirit (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">1 Corinthians 12:13</span>). The Spirit indwells, seals and gives spiritual gifts, at the moment of belief (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">2 Corinthians 3:15</span>), to all believers for ministry in the church and society (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Romans 8:9-11; Ephesians 1:13-14; Romans 12:5-8; 1 Peter 4:10</span>). He empowers, guides, teaches, fills, sanctifies and produces the fruit of Christ-likeness in all who yield to Him (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Acts 4:31; Romans 8:14; 1 Corinthians 2:10-13; Ephesians 5:18; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; Galatians 5:16; 22-23</span>).</li>

                            <li>We believe the **Bible is God's Word** given by divine inspiration, and is the record of God's revelation of Himself to humanity (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">2 Timothy 3:16</span>). It is the verbal, plenary, and inspired Word of God. The term “verbal” means that every word of the Bible in the original languages of Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek is without error. “Plenary” refers to the fact that the entirety of Scripture is equally inspired, and the Bible is “inspired” because it is God-breathed by the Holy Spirit to the human authors, whereby they recorded the words of Scripture using their human vocabulary and style (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">1 Peter 1:23-25; 2 Peter 1:20-21; John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16-17</span>).</li>
                            <li>We conclude that the Bible should be consistently interpreted using a **literal, grammatical-historical, contextual interpretation**. We reject allegorical, spiritual, or mystical approaches to interpreting Scripture, which leads us to reject Covenant Theology, Preterism, Post-Millennial Theology, Progressive and Hyper or Ultra-Dispensationalism and Amillennial Theology.</li>

Through Adam's willful choice to disobey God, sin and death entered the human race (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Genesis 3; Romans 5:12-21; 8:22</span>). Therefore, everyone is born with a sinful nature, and needs to be reconciled to God (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Romans 3:9-18; 23</span>).</li>

                            <li>**The Church Universal and Local:** The Church is the body of which Jesus Christ is the head, and all believers are members (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Ephesians 1:22-23; Romans 12:4-5</span>). The Church began on the Day of Pentecost after Jesus’s resurrection (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Acts 2:1-4, 11:15-16; 1 Corinthians 12:13</span>).</li>
                            <li>**Israel and the Church:** We realize that **Israel and the Church are two distinct entities** in the plan of God. The Church has not replaced the nation of Israel, nor has it taken her promised future blessings.</li>
                            <li>**Spiritual Gifts:** At the moment of faith, a person is indwelled by the Holy Spirit and receives spiritual gifts (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Romans 8:9-11, 1 Corinthians 3:16</span>). We believe that all of the **sign gifts have ceased** (apostle, prophesy, tongues, interpretation) since the completion of the canon of Scripture (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">1 Corinthians 13:10</span>).</li>

                            <li>Following the second coming of Christ, He will literally rule and reign from Jerusalem over a Kingdom of His own making for **one thousand years** (the Millennium) (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Revelation 20:1-6</span>).</li>
                            <li>After the Millennial Kingdom, the non-believing dead will be judged at the **Great White Throne Judgment** and consigned to everlasting punishment, while believers will be ushered into the eternal state with God in perfect fellowship (<span class="font-semibold text-cyan-700">Revelation 20:11-15; 21-22</span>).</li>
